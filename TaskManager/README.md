# Development Environment

* Python 3.11.3
* SQLite 3
* IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

# Future Work

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using a Python GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt.
- Add user authentication and authorization to secure the task manager.
- Implement a notification system to remind users of pending tasks or approaching deadlines.
- Provide task categorization and filtering options.
- Implement task prioritization and sorting based on different criteria.

# How to run:

1. Ensure that Python 3.9 or a later version is installed on your system.
2. Make sure SQLite 3 is available.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the task_manager.py file is located.
4. Run the following command to execute the code:

Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to interact with the Task Manager application.

Note: Before running the application, make sure you have necessary read and write permissions in the directory where the Python script is located. Also, ensure that no other processes are using a database file named tasks.db in the same directory to avoid conflicts.
