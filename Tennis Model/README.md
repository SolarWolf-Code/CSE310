# Overview

TennisModel was an attempt at creating a machine learning model using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dissfya/atp-tennis-2013-2023?resource=download). It is a classification model to determine who would win the match.

# Development Environment
* Intellij IDEA
* Python
* Tensorflow
* Git
* GitHub
* SciKit Learn
* Pandas

I used Tensorflow because it is the most popular machine learning library and I wanted to learn it. I used Pandas to clean the data and SciKit Learn to create the model.

# Useful Websites
- [Tensorflow Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/)
- [Pandas Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

# Future Work
- Add more data
- Add more features
- Add more layers to the model
- Add more neurons to the layers
- Add more epochs
- Use GPU to train the model

How to run:
`python3 model.py`
